{"name":"Depfinder","tagline":"Dependency aware sentence search engine for Japanese sentences","body":"\r\nDo you find it easy to search for example sentences on web?\r\nI sometimes do not.\r\nSearch engines like Google are looking for documents:\r\nlarge pieces for text which contain keywords in a query.\r\n\r\nBut... queries just on words do not work always well!\r\nDepFinder is a search engine which gives you more power,\r\nbut at the same time a bit more difficult to master than\r\na regular search engine.\r\n\r\n# What is DepFinder\r\n\r\nWell... It is a search engine.\r\nIt is available on\r\n[http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search).\r\nI try to have it online as much as possible, but\r\nsome there could be some downtime.\r\nTotal number of available sentences could vary from time to time as well.\r\n\r\nAnd no sources yet, sorry.\r\n\r\nUsually, search engines allows to do search only by words.\r\nDepFinder is different.\r\nIt allows to use:\r\n\r\n* words\r\n* dependencies\r\n* grammar\r\n* part of speech information\r\n\r\nThe first one is a usual part,\r\nother three are probably not.\r\nLet's see how exactly it is different from general search engines.\r\n\r\n## What can DepFinder do\r\n\r\nHere is a collection of interesting queries.\r\n\r\n#### Usage of onomatopoeia\r\n\r\n[~物が→ピリピリ→~動く\\*,-する\\*,@ピリピリ](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=~%E7%89%A9%E3%81%8C%E2%86%92%E3%83%94%E3%83%AA%E3%83%94%E3%83%AA%E2%86%92~%E5%8B%95%E3%81%8F*,-%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B*,@%E3%83%94%E3%83%AA%E3%83%94%E3%83%AA)\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find good examples for adverbs and especially onomatopoeia.\r\nBut it is not a problem for DepFinder.\r\n\r\n#### Checking if a word can be used in a certain situation\r\n\r\n[〜２つの→面から](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%E3%80%9C%EF%BC%98%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AE%E2%86%92%E9%9D%A2%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89)\r\n\r\nI used this query to find out whether it is possible to say in Japanese\r\n\"to think about a problem from X sides\" using a word 面.\r\n\r\n#### Usage of grammar\r\n\r\n* [@〜飛ぶ\\*->度に,@度に->〜飛ぶ\\*](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=@%E3%80%9C%E9%A3%9B%E3%81%B6*-%3E%E5%BA%A6%E3%81%AB,@%E5%BA%A6%E3%81%AB-%3E%E3%80%9C%E9%A3%9B%E3%81%B6*) -

Append * to find any grammatical form.\r\n\r\n### Part of Speech Query\r\n\r\nAre you already bored of sakura?\r\nI am.\r\nLet's find something else what can bloom.\r\nWe will do that by asking DepFinder the following query:\r\n[＠~桜が→咲く\\*](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%EF%BC%A0%E3%80%9C%E6%A1%9C%E3%81%8C%E2%86%92%E5%92%B2%E3%81%8F*).\r\nThe meaning of a new symbol -- tilde (~) is to\r\nfind sentences that contain\r\nwords that have *the same part of speech* as the word prefixed by a tilde.\r\nIn the query 桜 is a noun, so the query becomes\r\n\"find a noun with が that has 咲く in any form as a parent\"\r\nif described in English.\r\n\r\nOf course, this query works with other parts of speech as well:\r\n[＠〜綺麗な→家](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%EF%BC%A0%E3%80%9C%E7%B6%BA%E9%BA%97%E3%81%AA%E2%86%92%E5%AE%B6),\r\n[＠〜強く→吹く\\*](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%EF%BC%A0%E3%80%9C%E5%BC%B7%E3%81%8F%E2%86%92%E5%90%B9%E3%81%8F*),\r\n[＠〜ゆっくりの→俺](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%EF%BC%A0%E3%80%9C%E3%82%86%E3%81%A3%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E2%86%92%E4%BF%BA).\r\nBecause DepFinder keeps grammatical form of queries, part of speech queries can be useful for\r\nsearching a word **with** some grammar.\r\n\r\n> Use ~A to find sentences that contain words of the same part of speech as A.\r\n\r\n### Compound Query\r\n\r\nQueries described above are primitive.\r\nThey can be combined to search for even more complex things.\r\nBy separating two queries with a comma you get a single compound query:\r\n[＠聞く、＠動物](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%EF%BC%A0%E8%81%9E%E3%81%8F,%EF%BC%A0%E5%8B%95%E7%89%A9).\r\nIn general search systems like Google spaces are used as word separators,\r\nbut DepFinder uses comma in this meaning.\r\nAdditionally, all spaces in a query are ignored.\r\n\r\nCompound query searches for *at least one* of its parts,\r\nhowever it prefers to match as much parts as possible.\r\n\r\n##### Query Part Modifiers\r\n\r\nThere are three query part modifiers: @, + and -.\r\nThe first one was explained earlier.\r\nOther two have their usual meaning in search systems.\r\n\r\n###### Plus\r\n\r\nPlus modifier (+) makes the search engine to *always* match a query part marked by the plus.\r\nLet's compare the number of hits of two queries:\r\n[聞く、動物](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%E8%81%9E%E3%81%8F%E3%80%81%E5%8B%95%E7%89%A9) and\r\n[+聞く、+動物](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=%2B%E8%81%9E%E3%81%8F%E3%80%81%2B%E5%8B%95%E7%89%A9).\r\nThe first one essentially searches for either 聞く or 動物 in a sentence, however\r\nthe second one searches only for both at the same time.\r\nThis explains the difference in the number of hits.\r\n\r\n###### Minus\r\n\r\nMinus modifier (-) makes the search engine to find sentences that *does not*\r\nmatch a query part marked by the minus.\r\nFor example, let's find an action of sakura except blooming:\r\n[@桜が→~咲く,-咲く](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/depfinder/search?q=@%E6%A1%9C%E3%81%8C%E2%86%92~%E5%92%B2%E3%81%8F,-%E5%92%B2%E3%81%8F).\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nTODO: Write more clearly.\r\n\r\n### Priority/Precedence\r\n\r\nThe query operations have the following precedence or order of resolution:\r\n\r\n1. grammatical query\r\n1. part of speech query\r\n1. dependency query\r\n1. query part modifiers\r\n1. compound query separators\r\n\r\n### Query part scope\r\n\r\nEvery query part should be a [bunsetsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_grammar#Sentences.2C_phrases_and_words).\r\nBasically, it has usually one content word with all attached grammatical words.\r\n\r\nExamples of bunsetsu separation of sentences:\r\n\r\n* 毎朝｜日が｜登る　- particles are attached to the content words\r\n* 登りたくなってきたのに - that's a single bunsetsu, yes\r\n* 京都大学は｜大きい - compound nouns (京都大学) are treated as a single bunsetsu\r\n\r\nQueries like 桜が咲く will not work because they contain two bunsetsu, you need to\r\nseparate them either to compound or dependency query.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
